    <b>How the Web Works</b><br>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. 
When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. 
The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.</p>

<b>HTML</b><br>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. 
HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. 
HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks".</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b><br>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML elements. 
When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b><br>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. 
This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b><br>
<p>HTML elements are either inline or block. 
Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
